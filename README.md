# virtualWallHW

## Project Brief:
Repository to hold EAGLE files for Roomba Virtual Wall using PIC12F683

## Notes:
1) R7 was replaced by a 0 ohm resistor. 
2) C6 was also removed from the circuit. 
3) [SeeedStudio script](http://support.seeedstudio.com/knowledgebase/articles/1176949-how-to-generate-gerber-file-from-eagle) was used to generate manufacturing files.
4) Only the panelized brd file is included in this package. The schematic of the other board will be posted once that has been verified.
